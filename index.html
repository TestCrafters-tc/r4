        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The active voice is in the present simple tense ('embodies'). In the passive voice, the object 'all the good qualities' becomes the subject, and the verb 'embodies' changes to 'are embodied'. The subject 'My teacher' becomes the object 'by my teacher'.",

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "This is an imperative sentence. The passive voice for such sentences often starts with 'Let + object + be + past participle + of'. Here, the object is 'your health', the verb 'take care' becomes 'be taken care', and 'of' is retained.",

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "The active voice uses the modal verb 'must'. In the passive voice, the structure is 'object + must be + past participle'. Here, 'these doors' becomes the subject, and 'shut' is the past participle of 'shut'.",

        "explanation": "In the active voice, 'made' is followed by an infinitive without 'to' ('work'). In the passive voice, the object 'us' becomes the subject 'We', and the verb 'made' becomes 'were made'. The infinitive 'work' is often preceded by 'to' in such passive constructions, but in this case, the provided answer key suggests 'Work was made by him for us', which focuses on 'work' as the subject.",

        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The active voice is in the past simple tense ('broadcast'). In the passive voice, this becomes 'was/were + past participle'. 'The breaking news' is singular, so 'was broadcast' is correct. Note that 'broadcast' has the same form in the past simple and past participle.",

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "If the father is normal and the mother is homozygous colorblind, the son will inherit the Y chromosome from the father and the X chromosome with the colorblind allele from the mother, making the son colorblind.",

      "XHxh",

    "explanation": "In this case, the carrier mother (XHxh) has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the hemophilia allele. The normal father (XHY) has one normal X chromosome and one Y chromosome. The son inherits the Y chromosome from the father, and the X chromosome with the hemophilia allele (Xh) from the mother, resulting in XhY, which is affected by hemophilia.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Blood group AB has no antibodies in the plasma but has both A and B antigens present on the surface of the red blood cells. This means that individuals with blood group AB can receive blood from any of the other blood groups (A, B, AB, or O) without producing an immune response.",
